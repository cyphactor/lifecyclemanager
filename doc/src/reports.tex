\section{Overview}


\section{Formats}

\subsection{Timeline-format}

The \textit{Timeline}-format is a vertical list sorted by timestamp of
particular activity. If multiple activities occurred with the same timestamp,
they are grouped in that timestamp.

The top-level heading is the report's name and subheadings are timestamps.


\subsection{Entity-format}

The \textit{Entity}-format shows a set of information about one particular
entity. The view has a top-level heading of the name of the entity and
subheadings of particular attributes of that entity.

Succinct versions of other reports may be shown as attributes when they relate
to the particular entity shown.
